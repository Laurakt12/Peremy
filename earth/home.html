            <p>Astrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for human meaning
                in the stars. Astrology was introduced to the Greeks in the 4th
                century B.C. and was studied by Plato, Aristotle, and others. It
                was soon embraced by the Romans, who gave the zodiac signs their
                modern names, and has since spread throughout the entire world. </p>

            <p>Early astrologers knew it took 12 lunar cycles for the sun to
                return to its original position. They identified 12
                constellations that they observed and named them. The signs of the
                zodiac are split into four groups: Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Also
                each planet is associated with two signs, and the sun and the
                moon are associated with one each.
            </p>

            <p>A horoscope is a map of the zodiacal circle with Earth at the center
                and the top of the circle represents the highest point of the sun
                during the day. Your horoscope charts the relative positions of
                the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars at the time of your birth. Proper
                interpretation of a horoscope is both an art and a science and can
                reveal a lot about a person.
            </p>

                your zodiac sign and your compatability with other signs. Also make
